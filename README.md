Welcome to my profile!

My name is Christopher Lawall. I'm a coding enthusiast who aims to make a career of his passion. I have a few months of experience in Python, plus cursory familiarity with SQL, HTML, and CSS. This is due to my participation in an online Software Engineering Bootcamp hosted by HyperionDev, a notable tech-education company based in South Africa.
